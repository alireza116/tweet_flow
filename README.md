# geoTweet Flow
function to calculate shortest paths for tweet users on street networks

These functions are to acompany with the paper Bridging the "Bridging the information and physical space: Measuring flow from geo-located social media data on the street network".

The purpose of these is to help users extract shortest paths between consecutive tweet locations on top of a street netwrok.

This script is in progress. It currently uses Graph data from Urban Road Network Dataset (https://figshare.com/articles/Urban_Road_Network_Data/2061897)

Currently it uses NetworkX and Pandas and Scikit learn to create shortest path polylines.

TODO: update the functions with descriptions.
